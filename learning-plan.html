          <em>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</em> --The long
          term career path goal for me is to end up working as a dev for a
          company that provides the environment for me to carry on expanding my
          abilities. However I have a few options to think about with contacts
          in the industry that I could utilise after dev academy.

          >
          --I think the limitations I have when it comes to learning is that I
          don’t grasp concepts straight away like some people are able to do. I
          take some time to learn things fully and the success of my learning
          depends upon hard work and really applying myself rather than pure
          cognitive ability.

          >
          --I think time management is a big one for me as I like to spread
          myself thin and focus on many things (obviously giving up this
          lifestyle to try and kickstart my dev career). However I would like to
          go back to training a lot alongside working as a developer in the
          future which would require me to have great time management and not
          wasting chunks of time throughout the day procrastinating. I think
          this could be achieved by creating a routine I stick to throughout dev
          academy.

          --I think in order to work productively with others the effort from
          each person to communicate and build a positive relationship with each
          other will be important to create the best working environment
          possible and as a result of that positivity will come high quality
          work and productivity. I will try to be as communicative as I can and
          involved with others.

          --I have been thinking about this quite a bit this week as I have a
          lot of self doubt when it comes to being able to complete things. I
          would say the person I would go to if things start to become too
          intense would be my Dad. He has a very busy life in the industry as an
          IT programme manager and would be able to sympathise with me and
          advise me on how to manage stress.

            hours of the day 8-5ish so during the active time of the
            facilitators. I prefer to message them directly about being blocked
            however outside of the facilitator hours would be happy to ask the
            help desk. On campus would be easy as I think I thrive learning in
            the face to face environment and would be able to express my
            problems much easier and frequently.

        <em>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</em> --My long term goal and career pathway as far as I can see at the moment would be to work as hard as possible to position myself to get into a role I can grow in. Probably working in auckland as a developer if possible and then working my way into working overseas e.t.c

        --I think that my biggest strengths that I could pull on throughout bootcamp would be my ‘stickability’. I feel like when I start getting the hang of something and begin to develop a passion for it I have a drive to keep doing it and spend as much time as necessary developing my skills.

        >
        --I think that my biggest challenge when it comes to bootcamp will be the ability to seek help and ask others as I seem to have a shyness when it comes to this and I am not sure why. This will definitely be a weakness as it will slow me down hugely and I need to utilise the tools I have to learn faster.

        <em>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </em>
        My previous human skill that I would’ve liked to see develop was time management and to be honest at the moment I don’t think that I am tracking very well with this goal and need to be careful of regression and try to set some better habits in place before bootcamp begins. However I still get my stuff done but could utilise a lot more time than I currently do.

      <p><em>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
      </em>My expectation from the bootcamp team would be that help is provided wherever it is needed and immediately rather than in the foundations where you could be waiting for half an hour to be unblocked.

      <p><em>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
      </em> Throughout the bootcamp I think I will seek most of my guidance and help face to face and in person practical learning. However only when necessary and not before trying to debug myself and follow the normal procedures. I think the main thing for me is committing to working hard every single day without fail at what needs to be done and this will allow me to continuously improve rather than starting and then stopping and then starting again.</p>
