          <em>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</em> --The long
          term career path goal for me is to end up working as a dev for a
          company that provides the environment for me to carry on expanding my
          abilities. However I have a few options to think about with contacts
          in the industry that I could utilise after dev academy.

            learning.</em
          >
          --I think the limitations I have when it comes to learning is that I
          don’t grasp concepts straight away like some people are able to do. I
          take some time to learn things fully and the success of my learning
          depends upon hard work and really applying myself rather than pure
          cognitive ability.

            developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</em

          --I think time management is a big one for me as I like to spread
          myself thin and focus on many things (obviously giving up this
          lifestyle to try and kickstart my dev career). However I would like to
          go back to training a lot alongside working as a developer in the
          future which would require me to have great time management and not
          wasting chunks of time throughout the day procrastinating. I think
          this could be achieved by creating a routine I stick to throughout dev
          academy.

          --I think in order to work productively with others the effort from
          each person to communicate and build a positive relationship with each
          other will be important to create the best working environment
          possible and as a result of that positivity will come high quality
          work and productivity. I will try to be as communicative as I can and
          involved with others.

          --I have been thinking about this quite a bit this week as I have a
          lot of self doubt when it comes to being able to complete things. I
          would say the person I would go to if things start to become too
          intense would be my Dad. He has a very busy life in the industry as an
          IT programme manager and would be able to sympathise with me and
          advise me on how to manage stress.

            --Online I will always seek help if needed and try to work regular
            hours of the day 8-5ish so during the active time of the
            facilitators. I prefer to message them directly about being blocked
            however outside of the facilitator hours would be happy to ask the
            help desk. On campus would be easy as I think I thrive learning in
            the face to face environment and would be able to express my
            problems much easier and frequently.
