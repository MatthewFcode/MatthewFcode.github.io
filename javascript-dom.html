      <summary>Intro</summary>
      <p>
        To kick it off java script is the language out of the core three (HTML,
        CSS included) that is the hardest to learn due to the fact that
        sometimes it can feel like it's got a mind of its own. It is complex and
        you can achieve the same results many different ways. It is best to
        create good habits of using java script efficiently rather than writing
        out long in efficient code.

      <summary>Analogy of JS</summary>
      <p>
        I love the analogy of the house when it comes to comparing programming
        languages to the real world because some of the roles are extremely
        accurate. If we imagine HTML as the structure of the house; you know the
        bits that keep it standing and all of that important stuff. Then CSS
        would be the bits that make it look nice e.g interior design. Javascript
        would be the functionality of the house like making sure there water is
        coming out of the tap and that the lights turn on and off e.t.c

      <summary>Control Flow</summary>
      <p>
        Control flow is the order that the code actually runs. For example the
        js file you have has a bunch of your javascript in it and when that code
        runs the code is executed in an order. Conditionals where code executes
        if certain conditions are true or false are a type of control flow. A
        real life example of this would be like if it was raining outside you
        would go to the gym to run on the treadmill but if it wasn’t raining you
        would run outside. Loops where code executes to the specificity of the
        programmer is a type of control flow. A real life example of this would
        be like a morning routine. Most people have the same morning routine
        every day. They get up and have a shower and then have breakfast, brush
        their teeth and get changed. This would be a loop that repeats generally
        for the length of someone's life. Calling functions that perform
        specific code is also a type of control flow. Functions as an analogy
        would be like making dinner for yourself. If a function had a name
        makeButterChicken. You know the recipe and the steps to make it and when
        you want to make butter chicken for dinner you do it. Just like calling
        makeButterChicken when you want butter chicken.

      <summary>DOM</summary>
      <p>
        The DOM stands for the document object model and is basically the tree
        like structure of the HTML elements. Each different HTML element is its
        own ‘node’ on the tree. It’s easy to separate the rest of java script
        syntax with the syntax you learn about manipulating the DOM but that
        isn't what you want to do as you use the DOM in your other javascript to
        add interactivity to elements e.t.c. You can select your elements in the
        js file using different queries.

      <p>
        The main difference between arrays and objects is how they behave rather
        than actually how they store the data in them. Arrays are stored like
        ordered lists and each element in the array is numbered using index so
        starting at 0 for the first element. Arrays are ebay for listing things.
        Objects are data stored about something that can have more objects
        inside it, so best for storing data about something in general rather
        than using a specific list. You can access the objects using the key
        names.

        The most basic definition of what a function actually is would be that
        it is a snippet of code that you write to perform a ‘function’ or task
        that can then be called again anytime you want. Functions can become
        quite advanced and you can call other functions inside another function
        (which are called call back functions). Functions can be quite advanced
        and can complete a whole variety of things as you can call for loops and
        conditionals and add variables e.t.c inside them
