        --Growing up, I was taught that hard work comes first and rewards come
        after—and that’s really shaped the way I approach life. My parents are
        both very driven, and they always encouraged me to put in the effort,
        even when things got tough. That mindset helped me develop a strong
        sense of discipline and made me take real ownership of my goals.

        --My strength will be that when I start something and get rhythm going I
        get passionate about that thing very quickly and strive to be the best
        at it.

        --I would say the limitations I will face in my learning developments
        will be the ones I have already mentioned in terms of focusing and
        getting started on tasks. Once I get off track a little I find it very
        hard to get back on track .

        --In one of my first semester group projects last year I had a couple of
        friends in the same group as me and we didn't manage who was doing which
        parts of the assessment when and have regular checkups to work together
        on each other's issues but instead left it to the last minute
