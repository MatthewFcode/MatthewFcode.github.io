            The way that understanding the principles of neuroplasticity
            benefits people is mainly because it majorly boosts the belief in
            that individual. It shifts the personâ€™s mindset from originally
            being fixed and stuck in the loop of thinking that their
            intelligence is something that is fixed and cannot be changed.
            Understanding the concept that intelligence is something that can be
            influenced is vital in changing the individuals attitude towards
            learning and instead of being disengaged they can switch themselves
            into the growth mindset. However you have to apply yourself to new
            things to see the rewards of the new connections being made.

            The growth mindset is the process of thinking where you believe that
            with the necessary engagement and practice with something new you
            can train your brain to learn new things you hadnâ€™t believed that
            you could learn. People with the growth mindset show higher
            resilience especially to receiving criticism and are able to tackle
            difficult problems with enthusiasm. I think the best way to
            integrate it into my learning would be to seek out the difficult
            challenges and tackle them and then get into the habit of doing
            this.

            My learning plan will mainly stay the same however there would be a
            couple of extra commitments to make regarding trying out the
            concepts that seem hard and not procrastinating them. This will
            develop into a rhythm of learning how to do the hard things e.t.c.
