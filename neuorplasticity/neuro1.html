      <p>
        The way that understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
        people is mainly because it majorly boosts the belief in that
        individual. It shifts the person’s mindset from originally being fixed
        and stuck in the loop of thinking that their intelligence is something
        that is fixed and cannot be changed. Understanding the concept that
        intelligence is something that can be influenced is vital in changing
        the individuals attitude towards learning and instead of being
        disengaged they can switch themselves into the growth mindset. However
        you have to apply yourself to new things to see the rewards of the new
        connections being made.
      </p>

      <p>
        The growth mindset is the process of thinking where you believe that
        with the necessary engagement and practice with something new you can
        train your brain to learn new things you hadn’t believed that you could
        learn. People with the growth mindset show higher resilience especially
        to receiving criticism and are able to tackle difficult problems with
        enthusiasm. I think the best way to integrate it into my learning would
        be to seek out the difficult challenges and tackle them and then get
        into the habit of doing this.
      </p>

      <p>
        My learning plan will mainly stay the same however there would be a
        couple of extra commitments to make regarding trying out the concepts
        that seem hard and not procrastinating them. This will develop into a
        rhythm of learning how to do the hard things e.t.c.
