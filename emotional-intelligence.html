                When it comes to focusing on building knowledge and skills for a
                successful career in any field, EQ is one of the most important
                thingsâ€” and also one of the most overlooked. Being controlled by
                your negative, self-judging emotions is something that holds
                nearly everyone back. Having the EQ to recognize those emotions
                and control them will enable you to not only get along well with
                others and not let what people do around you affect you as much,
                but also to focus more deeply on your skills and learning for
                longer periods. Itâ€™s like taking back control over your own mind
                and not letting your emotions and reactions be in the driverâ€™s
                seat all the time.

                <strong>How to train EQ</strong>
              </summary>
              <p class="emotional-para">
                The main two methods for training your EQ would be to practice
                mindfulness and meditation to clear your mind of the intense
                emotions that are usually floating around. The next best method
                would be journaling, as itâ€™s a great way to get your thoughts
                out â€” and you donâ€™t have to feel uncomfortable telling anyone
                about them, since itâ€™s a completely personalized experience.
                Reflecting on how you react to different situations, and taking
                mental note of those reactions and what you could do better next
                time, is how you train your brain to recognize when something
                makes you feel a certain way. From there, you are in control of
                yourself in that situation.
