              <em>NEW SKILLS AND LEARNING-</em> I am not sure how much more I
              have learnt about myself other than the fact that some of my
              self-talk tendencies seem to follow a negative pattern. However my
              ego seems to remain despite this which is confusing.

              <em>EMPATHY AND SELF AWARENESS-</em> I think empathy towards
              yourself can be quite important when it comes to programming.
              However I believe the biggest empathy you can have for yourself is
              staying on top of your work load so you can feel relatively
              confident in your work ethic and enable yourself the opportunity
              for growth by putting in the effort.

              <em>BIGGEST SUPRISE-</em>What has surprised me most is how
              transferable the skills are towards the programming side of the
              course and how mindset and habit are all key factors in achieving
              the programming success.

              <em>BIGGEST CHALLENGE-</em> The most challenging aspect was
              getting myself and my mind on board with accepting the focus on
              them and putting in effort to think about and reflect on them.

              <em>DEV ACADEMY ON HS-</em>I think the reason that devacademy is
              spending so much time focusing on human skills is so that the
              students don’t come out as one dimensional people who can just
              code. They want the students to come out as the full package of
              people with technical skills but also the social skills to succeed
              in the work environment socially and also in the habits they
              create for themselves in the future.

              <em>TIME SPENT ON HS-</em>I don’t necessarily think that the time
              I have spent studying human skills has necessarily been a waste of
              time, however I do think that I had built up knowledge prior to
              the course and had a decent level of self awareness when it comes
              to these sorts of topics but learning more about them and
              reflecting has been super cool.
