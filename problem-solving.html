          The problem that I was less stuck on but more confused as to its
          functionality and its syntax was one of the pieces of javascript in
          the javascript cafe exercise.

            The goal of the function was to get elements by their ids and
            manipulate their HTML and add object values in there. I hadnâ€™t
            encountered many problem solving techniques at this point so I
            dissected each line and figured out eventually what would happen if
            the function was called. The process of working out this problem was
            the same as any other hard problems. It felt hard and took some time
            to figure out how each piece of code worked together but it fades
            into the light with perseverance. I learnt that simply spending the
            necessary time with a problem is vital in helping you solve it.

          One problem that I think I solved elegantly was using methods to
          reverse a string which is pretty simple.
          <details>
            <summary id="header-log">Readmore</summary>
            I broke down the steps and knew exactly what each method I used did
            and it passed all the tests on the first time. I was able to break
            down the problem in my head by thinking of each method as a
            completely different array and the last one always being the one
            that delivers the final product. I learnt that making things work
            first time feels really good, however it wonâ€™t happen too often
            during the learning phase and sometimes you wonâ€™t even know
            beforehand if your code is going to work or not.

          I feel very confident using pseudocode as a problem solving technique
          as I use it to explain what I need to do or have done in detail to
          figure out my next steps.

            I donâ€™t usually just try something but if I have absolutely no idea
            then I will go and just give the problem and educated guess on what
            feels natural then seek assistance. The rubber ducky method has also
            been very helpful in realising typos e.t.c in my code as you read it
            out it becomes apparent.

          There is a specific time I can think of when I was reluctant to ask
          for help and that was when I had some trouble linking my files
          <details>
            <summary id="header-log">Read more</summary>
            because some of them were in different folders. I thought it was a
            super straight forward thing to do but I couldnâ€™t work out for the
            life of me what I was doing wrong and felt really stupid about it
            but asking for help actually made me feel better and then I was able
            to fix the problem and move on so now I try and ask for help as soon
            as I am sure that I wonâ€™t figure out my issue by myself.
